# Face Generator

In this project, I used some GAN model for Face Generator using CelebFaces Attributes (CelebA) Dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/celeba-dataset. 

A GAN consists of two neural networks:

**Generator:** This network takes a random noise vector as input and generates images that resemble the real training data. Its goal is to "fool" the discriminator into thinking its fake images are real.

**Discriminator:** This is the discriminative network. Itâ€™s a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained to classify inputs as either real (from the training data) or fake (generated by the generator). The discriminator serves as a binary classifier, distinguishing between actual images from the dataset and the synthetic ones created by the generator.
